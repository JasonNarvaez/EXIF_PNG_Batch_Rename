# EXIF_PNG_Batch_Rename
This project (python script) extracts EXIF metadata from PNG files in a given directory, renames, and timestamps them based on the passed in name.
This is mainly an exercise in Python that aimed to solve an inconvenience encountered when dumping pictures and videos from my drone.
